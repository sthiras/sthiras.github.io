                            <p>Freshdesk, a project started by my friends and me, was a workspace on-demand platform that offers a convenient network of workspaces of any type, unlocking productivity for mobile workers wherever and whenever they need it, with pay-as-you-go pricing.</p>
                            <p>The project started from my experience as a freelance designer. I usually needed to find a place to work or meet my clients and often ended up at a Starbucks because it was a convenient choice. Although I enjoyed the cafe vibe, sometimes it was so crowded that I couldn&rsquo;t focus on my work. Finding an ideal workspace was never a good experience for me. Realizing that mobilization was an emerging trend in work culture and more people were going to work from anywhere, I wondered how I could improve the experience in mobile working.</p>

                        <div class="project-body">
                            <p>Following the design thinking approach, I started by observing and interviewing 20+ mobile workers and 10+ workspaces and cafes. I narrowed down the target group to mobile workers between the age of 20-40 who are often on the go and occasionally need a workspace at different locations. The insightful finding was that many of them like to go to cafes like Starbucks because of the cozy atmosphere, tasty food, and convenience. But they share common pain points such as too much distraction, a lack of privacy, low productivity, and a lack of facilities. Some prefer more formal workspaces like co-working spaces for more serious work. Still, they don&rsquo;t think co-working spaces fit their on-the-go nature. Co-working spaces are not easily accessible like cafes. They are hard to find, have a cumbersome registering or checking in/out process, and are expensive since lower prices are usually members-only, not for one-time customers who only need to work for a few hours or even a few minutes.</p>
                            <p>After using tools like persona and user journey to identify pain points and define the problem, my friends and I brainstormed to find ideas. Early ideas were mainly focusing on improving the experience of working in cafes. We went back and forth to test our ideas with the users. Finally, we settled on our final approach, a workspace on-demand platform consisting of three solutions: creating a network of workspaces, providing walk-in passes and booking, and offering pay-as-you-go pricing.</p>

                            <p>Before prototyping, I created simple branding and communication design. Since our mission is to support mobile workers and improve their experience, I played with visuals and illustrations that feel fun and inspire them to work. Bright blue and warm orange colors represent productivity and comfort.</p>
