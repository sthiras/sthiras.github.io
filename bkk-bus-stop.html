                            <p>Bangkok informative bus stop was a collaborative project led by Mayday, in collaboration with ThaiGa, TAB, TEDxBangkok, TCDC, and Boonmee Lab. It started with an experiment during the royal mourning period aimed to allow Thai and foreign visitors to use public transportation more conveniently. The experiment was well received and they decided to expand the project further, which resulted in 120 bus stop signs installed across Bangkok.</p>
                            <p>I worked as a member of the design team to develop the prototype from idea to final design. Following the user-centered approach, we started with research. I did 20+ user interviews and on-site contextual inquiries to understand the problems. In weekly collaborative sessions, we shared our research, pitched our ideas, discussed problems and solutions, created prototypes, and tested with users. The final design was a signage that fit into the bus stop pole, featuring information, in both Thai and English, on buses that passed the stop along with other mass transportation, such as the BTS, MRT, ARL, and Express boats</p>
                            <p>The challenge was accessibility and practicality, we needed to put a lot of information into a limited space, make sure it was readable from a far distance, and communicate effectively with a diverse audience, for example. We used a modular layout for consistency and feasibility of maintenance and installation. The names of bus stops should be intuitive and not confusing, so we referred to the data from research to choose the most recognizable names. For typography, concerning legibility, our choice was a looped humanist font. As well as for colors, we picked a color scheme that allows the color-blinded audience to read.</p>
                            <p>I learned from this project a lot about data-driven design and design for the public. It sparked my interest in inclusive design and inspired me to dig deeper into the subject.</p>
