                            <p>Finding Abstraction, by BACC, was a Thai abstract sculptural art exhibition featuring works of four Thai renowned artists. The exhibition is a presentation of different creative processes involved, from origin of ideas, study, discovery of attributes found in abstraction, and communication in form of abstraction that is channeled into a sculptural form.</p>
                            <p>I worked with BACC exhibition department to design a visual identity for the exhibition, responsible for designing visual communication on all platforms, including print, digital, and environmental graphics.</p>
                            <p>Starting by studying the works and creative processes of the artists, I found the nature of abstract sculptures to be interesting, they are non-objective, indistinct, and sometimes act like a puzzle for the viewer to solve. I decided to take inspiration from that.</p>
                            <p>I experimented with abstract and simplified shapes, forms, and letters. The final logo consists of shapes that are derived from some of the sculptures, and a typography designed to be a little bit of a puzzle to be solved.</p>
                            <p>The objective of this exhibition is to show that the creation of abstract art is not something out of reach for the audience. So I incorporate some pop elements into the overall mood and tone, color scheme, and composition to imply approachability.</p>
