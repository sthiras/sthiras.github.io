                            <p>Finding Abstraction was a Thai abstract sculptural art exhibition by BACC featuring the works of four renowned Thai artists. The exhibition presented the various creative processes involved in creating abstract sculptures, from the origins of ideas to the communication of these ideas in sculptural form.</p>
                            <p>I worked with the BACC exhibition department to design a visual identity for the exhibition. My responsibilities included designing visual communication materials for all platforms, including print, digital, and environmental graphics.</p>
                            <p>To begin the design process, I studied the artists' works and creative processes. I found the nature of abstract sculptures to be particularly interesting, as they are often non-objective, indistinct, and act like puzzles for the viewer to solve. I took this idea as inspiration for my design.</p>
                            <p>I experimented with various abstract and simplified shapes, forms, and letters to create the final logo. The shapes used in the logo were derived from some of the sculptures, and the typography was designed to be slightly puzzle-like to engage the audience.</p>
                            <p>The objective of the exhibition was to show that abstract art is not out of reach for the audience. To achieve this, I incorporated pop elements into the overall mood and tone, color scheme, and composition to make the exhibition more approachable. The resulting visual identity captures the essence of the exhibition and the nature of abstract sculpture, while also being inviting and accessible to the audience.</p>
                            <p>For environmental graphics, I designed a series of signage to guide the audience through the exhibition space and provide information about the artists and their works. These graphics used the same visual language as the logo, further reinforcing the exhibition's overall visual identity.</p>
