                            <p>Picture Perfect was the first exhibition in the BACC Photo series that presented alternative viewpoints on beauty and reality through the work of female photographers.</p>
                            <p>I worked with the BACC exhibition department to design a visual identity for the exhibition, responsible for creating a visual language that could be used across all platforms, including print, digital, and environmental graphics.</p>
                            <p>The name &quot;Picture Perfect&quot; represents the ideal beauty presented in a photograph, comparable to the perfect beauty of a woman. When we think of ideal beauty, we often have a certain set of patterns or qualities in mind, such as the perfect shape, perfect proportion, and perfect lighting. There are even rules like the golden ratio that we believe make a picture or human face perfect.</p>
                            <p>Just as the exhibition challenges these beauty standards through photography, I wanted the visual identity to represent the same idea. The concept I chose was &quot;perfectionism,&quot; which can be seen as both positive and sarcastic. To embody this concept, I used symmetrical compositions and stacked geometric shapes and lines on top of each other to remind viewers of the excessive rules and measurements often seen in these beauty standards. The letters were also constructed from perfect geometric shapes.</p>
                            <p>In addition to print and digital materials, I also designed environmental graphics for the exhibition space, including signage and video, to help guide visitors through the space and provided information about the photographs and photographers. These were designed using the same visual language, creating a cohesive and immersive experience.</p>
