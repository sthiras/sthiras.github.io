                            <p>Picture Perfect, by BACC, is an exhibition that presents how the world is seen through photographs that show subtlety of life in the contemporary age and alternative viewpoints of beauty and purity hidden in flaws of reality. Being first photography series exhibition, it opens up viewpoints towards women through female photographers&rsquo; works.</p>
                            <p>I worked with BACC exhibition department to design a visual identity for the exhibition, responsible for designing visual communication on all platforms, including print, digital, and environmental graphics.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Picture Perfect&rdquo; is the representative of the ideal beauty presented in a picture at the same level as a perfect beauty of a woman. When talking about ideal beauty, we often have a certain set of patterns or qualities in our minds, perfect shape, perfect proportion, and perfect lighting, to name a few. There are rules like the golden ratio that we believe make a picture or even a human face perfect.</p>
                            <p>Like how the exhibition questioned those beauty standards through photography, I wanted to represent the same idea in the visual identity. The concept was &ldquo;perfectionism&rdquo; which can be perceived as both positive and sarcastic. I aligned every element to be perfectly symmetrical. Several geometrical shapes and lines were stacked over one another to remind us of those excessive rules and measurements in beauty standards. The letters were also constructed from perfect geometrical shapes.</p>
