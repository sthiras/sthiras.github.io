                            <p>Vanich is a fashion brand by a young Thai designer that brings traditional Thai silk into contemporary and fresh designs. The garments are tailor-made with attention to detail, and the brand's motto is &quot;For only you shine through every time you wear.&quot;</p>
                            <p>The first thing I noticed from their dresses was the colorfulness and shininess of the silk fabric in classic-inspired silhouettes. Smocking and ruffles are distinctive details often found in their designs, and I wanted to capture the mischievous spirit of the brand in the visual identity.</p>
                            <p>I explored several different logo designs to find the perfect one that would convey the flamboyance and playfulness of the brand. I ultimately settled on a modern high-contrast wordmark design with letterforms inspired by the curves and details of the dresses.</p>
                            <p>The primary colors for the brand are black and white, which give a clean and luxurious look and don't compete with colorful garments. Metallic and holographic effects were also added to give the brand a little bit of playful personality</p>
                            <p>Additionally, I also created a brand book for Vanich that covers the brand's typography, visual guidelines, and brand applications. This comprehensive guide ensures that all materials and applications accurately reflect the brand's values and aesthetics, and provides clear guidelines for maintaining a consistent visual identity.</p>
