                            <p>SpaceTH was an online marketplace that makes it easier to find and book unique spaces for any activity. The five main categories are commercial, corporate, celebration, production, and lifestyle.</p>
                            <p>My role in this project was designing brand identity, product UX/UI, and also developing front-end user interface for the MVP.</p>

                            <p>Beginning with identity design, I came up with the idea &ldquo;A space is meaningless, without a user making use of it in a meaningful way.&rdquo; So I designed the logo to represent a blank space and played with how to combine it with different elements to create different meanings. As a result, the primary logo can be extended to make sub-brand logos for each of the five categories. For mood and tone, I aimed to convey a professional, fun, and inviting feeling, with shapes and colors. Additionally, I made the logo variable so it can adapt based on context, to create a multi-platform and scalable branding.</p>

                            <p>Designing UX/UI in the MVP stage, we focused on two main flows consisting of listing creation and discovery, allowing space owners to add their listing and users to discover spaces.</p>
                            <p>We did interviews and testing with space owners to understand their insight. There were three biggest pain points: the forms are lengthy, it&rsquo;s not practical to finish the form at one time, and it's hard to imagine what the finished page will look like during creation. My solution was to create a WYSIWYG editor with the fewest required fields possible, Providing a preview function, a save draft function, and a completeness indicator. This allowed users to draft and come back to finish the listing later before submitting it.</p>
                            <p>For discovery flow, the challenge was that data vary so much from one category to another, a hotel room has very different properties from a swimming pool for example. The UI solutions I came up with include sub-landing pages, tagging, color coding, and context-based search form and filters, to make it easier for a user to navigate through categories with fewer extra steps.</p>

                            <p>To ensure consistency throughout the platform and make a unified brand experience, I created a design system with detailed UI guidelines, an icon set, and illustrations.</p>
