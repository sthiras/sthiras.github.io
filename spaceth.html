                            <p>SpaceTH is an online marketplace that makes it easier to find and book unique spaces for any activity. The platform's main categories include commercial, corporate, celebration, production, and lifestyle.</p>
                            <p>As a designer, I was responsible for designing the brand identity, product UX/UI, and developing the front-end user interface for the MVP.</p>

                            <p>Beginning with identity design, I came up with the idea that &quot;a space is meaningless without a user making use of it in a meaningful way.&quot; So, I designed the logo to represent a blank space and experimented with combining it with different elements to create different meanings. As a result, the primary logo can be extended to create sub-brand logos for each of the five categories. The logo was designed to be flexible and adaptable based on context, allowing it to be used across multiple platforms and scaling as needed. For mood and tone, I aimed to convey a professional, fun, and inviting feel through the use of shapes and colors.</p>

                            <p>For the UX/UI design of the MVP, I focused on two main flows: listing creation and discovery, allowing space owners to add their listings and users to discover spaces.</p>
                            <p>We conducted interviews and testing with space owners to identify the problems. The three biggest pain points were that the forms were lengthy, it was not practical to complete the form in one session, and it was difficult to imagine what the finished page would look like during creation. To address these issues, I created a WYSIWYG editor with the fewest required fields possible and added preview, save draft, and completeness indicator functions. This allowed users to easily draft and save their listings before submitting them.</p>
                            <p>For the discovery flow, the challenge was that data varied greatly from one category to another. For example, a hotel room has very different properties from a swimming pool. To make it easier for users to navigate through the various categories and find the spaces they need, I implemented sub-landing pages, color coding, tagging, and context-based search forms and filters.</p>
