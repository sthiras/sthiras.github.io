                            <p>21impact, a ShareInvestor Thailand subsidiary, is a technology company that combines human-oriented approaches and best-of-breed technology to deliver innovative digital solutions and provide professional consultation. The company's slogan is &quot;We create digital platforms with maximum impact in the 21st century.&quot;</p>
                            <p>As part of the brand identity design project, I developed the corporate identity for 21impact, including the logo, visual guidelines, and brand book.</p>
                            <p>To create the brand identity, I started by identifying three main keywords that reflect 21impact's focus on human-oriented principles and its position as a &quot;new wave&quot; bringing impact to the modern world. These keywords were &quot;technology&quot;, &quot;movement&quot;, and &quot;human&quot;. I explored multiple directions to translate them into unique design concepts and ultimately decided on a wordmark inspired by wave shapes and human handwriting. This design represents the relationship between humans and technology, which is central to 21impact's values and approach.</p>
                            <p>The bright green color represents trust, innovation, and technology, as well as creativity and humanity. The supporting visual and design elements were also designed to imply movement and energy. The brand book that I created for 21impact includes the use of the logo, typography, color palette, layout, imagery, and brand applications.</p>
