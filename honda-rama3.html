                            <p>With their mission to transform their business into digital, they wanted to create an online channel to deliver a seamless experience to customers by building a website serving four main functions: car sales, service booking, insurance broking, and job application.</p>

                            <p>When working on visual design, I began with the slogan &rdquo;We give you more.&rdquo; for the design direction. I wanted to convey a bright, active, and expansive feeling inspired by urban landscape through visual design. This concept carried over to UI elements, layouts, colors, images, illustrations, and a custom icon set.</p>

                            <p>For service booking, the priority is to make it easy for a user to leave an inquiry without going back and forth through multiple pages. I redesigned the user flow, eliminated unnecessary steps, and utilized a context-based floating menu for quick access.</p>
                            <p>For insurance broking, the problem is the overwhelming information about different insurance packages. So to simplify it by creating an interactive user interface to visualize different coverings and prices between different tiers.</p>
                            <p>In car details pages, the contents are dynamic and vary a lot between car models. To make it manageable and updatable with CMS, we decided to use a modular design. I had to work with the dev team to design different modules and components.</p>
