                            <p>Rama3 Group Honda is the top Honda car showroom with the most branches in Thailand. There are currently 8 branches covering Bangkok and its vicinity with more than 700 employees.</p>
                            <p>With their mission to transform their business into digital, I was responsible for UX/UI design, creating a seamless online experience for their customers. I worked closely with the project manager to gather business requirements and develop wireframes and specifications for the website, which serves four main functions: car sales, service booking, insurance broking, and job application.</p>

                            <p>In my visual design work, I used the slogan &quot;We give you more&quot; as a guiding principle, creating a visual design that conveyed a bright, active, and expansive feeling inspired by urban landscapes. This concept carried over to all aspects of the design, from colors and images to layouts and custom icon sets.</p>

                            <p>One of the key challenges of the project was streamlining the service booking process, making it easy for users to leave an inquiry without navigating through multiple pages. To solve this problem, I redesigned the user flow and eliminated unnecessary steps, while also implementing a context-based floating menu as a call to action to encourage users to take the next step.</p>
                            <p>Another challenge was simplifying the insurance broking process, which was overwhelming due to the vast amount of information about different insurance packages. I created an interactive user interface that visualized different coverings and prices between different tiers, making it easier for users to understand their options.</p>
                            <p>In the car details pages, the contents were dynamic and varied greatly between car models. To make the design manageable and updatable with a CMS, we used a modular design. I worked closely with the dev team to design the necessary modules and components.</p>
                            <p>To further enhance the user experience, I also utilized animation in several key areas of the design to add visually appealing elements and engagement to the design.</p>
