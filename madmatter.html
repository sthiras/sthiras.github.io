                            <p>Madmatter is a casual lifestyle brand by Thai designers with a genuine passion for using the most eco-friendly practices possible. The brand's philosophy is &quot;waste to worth,&quot; and almost 100% of their products are made from used clothing and deadstock fabrics.</p>
                            <p>I was responsible for designing Madmatter's original logo when the brand was established. It was a small project where I only created a logo. Recently, I decided to revisit it and expand on it, which resulted in this personal redesign project.</p>

                            <p>In my design process, I started by identifying keywords that best defined the brand. Sustainability was the most important quality to convey, along with the comfortable, elegant, and minimalist style of Madmatter's products. After researching the fashion industry, I realized that a logotype format would be ideal for modern fashion brands because of its flexibility and simplicity. I experimented with different typography and lettering designs for the logo and ultimately settled on a humanist sans-serif style that conveyed a natural and modern aesthetic. The final design features subtle organic curves, loose spacing for a comfortable feel, a distinctive tt ligature, and ink traps to reference sustainability in printing.</p>

                            <p>I enjoyed applying the sustainability concept to the entire branding system, not only visually but also in terms of the brand experience through packaging design, storytelling, and other applications. My favorite part of the design is the small mark on the recycled paper shopping bag that reads &quot;Please recycle me.&quot;</p>
