                            <p>Madmatter is a casual lifestyle brand by Thai designers with a genuine passion for using the most eco-friendly practices possible. With &ldquo;Waste to worth&rdquo; as their philosophy, almost 100% of their products are made from used clothing and deadstock fabrics.</p>
                            <p>I designed the original logo for Madmatter since the establishment of the brand. It was a small project where I only created a logo. Recently reviewing my old works, I liked the concept of the brand and felt inspired to expand on it, which resulted in this personal redesign project.</p>

                        <p>My design process started by identifying keywords that most precisely define the brand. Sustainability is the most important quality that should be reflected in the design, along with the comfy, elegant, minimalist style of their products. From researching the fashion industry, I learned that the logotype format was the way to go for modern fashion brands because of its flexibility and simplicity. After trying different typography and lettering designs for the logo, I settled on a humanist sans-serif style because they can be seen as natural while still looking modern. The final design has subtle natural curves, loose spacing that conveys comfort, distinctive tt ligature, and ink traps that also associates with sustainability in printing.</p>

                        <p>Having &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo; as the main idea. I had a lot of fun applying the concept to the whole branding system not only visually but also as a brand experience through packaging design, storytelling, and other applications. My favorite one is the tiny little mark on the shopping bag made of recycled paper that says &ldquo;Please recycle me&rdquo;</p>
