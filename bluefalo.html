                            <p>Bluefalo Company Limited is an OEM pet food manufacturer that provides healthy and nutritional pet foods for dogs, cats, fish, birds, rabbits, and hamsters. With more than 15 years of experience, they have expanded their product lines and are now exporting to over 15 countries and launching their own ODM brands.</p>
                            <p>The company's old branding was inconsistent and confusing, with an outdated website that was difficult to maintain or update. My responsibility was to create a unified branding, redesign the corporate identity and the corporate website to be up-to-date, ready for the future, and supportive of their mission to go international.</p>

                            <p>I wanted to bring a fresh and friendly feeling to the brand, reflecting an image of &quot;a warm and caring expert&quot; rather than a manufacturing factory. To achieve this, I chose &quot;a science journal&quot; as the design concept, symbolizing knowledge and expertise with a sense of warmth and kindness. This is reflected in the design, which incorporates elements associated with journaling, such as grids, lines, scribbles, and illustrations. I also played with the shapes of pet food pallets in the design. The logo is designed to be functional, serving as a dynamic and adaptive system that can be used across different applications and platforms.</p>

                            <p>The corporate website is a crucial channel for reaching out to customers around the world. My design aimed to showcase Bluefalo's values and strengths by focusing on manufacturing standards and expertise in nutrition and display a wide range of products with well-prioritized information while highlighting nutritional facts and product customizability. The visual design followed the same principles as the brand identity, with a modern, clean, and friendly user interface, enhanced by animations and interactive elements to create a more engaging experience. Responsive techniques were used to ensure support for modern devices, and design limitations required for content management using a CMS were taken into account.</p>
