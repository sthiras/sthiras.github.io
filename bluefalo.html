                            <p>Bluefalo Company Limited is an OEM Pet food manufacturer that provides healthy and nutritional pet foods. With more than 15 years of experience, They have expanded their lines to produce food products for dogs, cats, fish, birds, rabbits, and hamsters. Today, they are now exporting to over 15 countries and launching their own ODM brands.</p>
                            <p>Bluefalo&rsquo;s old identity was inconsistent and confusing. The website was outdated, didn&rsquo;t provide useful information, and was difficult to maintain or update. My responsibility was to create a unified branding, redesign the corporate identity and the corporate website to be up-to-date, ready for the future, and supportive of their mission to go international.</p>

                        <p>For corporate identity, I wanted to bring a fresh and friendly feeling to the brand. So the direction was to reflect an image of &rdquo;a warm and caring expert&rdquo; rather than an image of a manufacturing factory. Based on this direction, I chose &ldquo;a science journal&rdquo; as the design concept because it symbolizes knowledge and expertise with a sense of warmth and kindness. As a result, the design incorporates some elements associated with journaling, such as grids, lines, scribbles, and illustrations. At the same time, I also played with the shapes of pet food pallets. The logo is designed with functionality in mind. It&rsquo;s not just a logo but a system that is dynamic, adaptive, and ready to be used across different applications and platforms.</p>

                        <p>The corporate website is important because it&rsquo;s their main channel to reach out to customers around the world. The main functions are to display Bluefalo&rsquo;s values and strengths by focusing on manufacturing standards and expertise in nutrition. Along with showcasing a wide range of products with well-prioritized information while highlighting nutritional facts and product customizability. For visual design, I followed the same principle as the brand identity, designing a modern, clean, and friendly user-interface and added animations and interactive elements to create more engaging experience. Additionally, responsive technique is used to ensure that modern devices are supported and design limitations required to allow content management using CMS were taken into account.</p>
